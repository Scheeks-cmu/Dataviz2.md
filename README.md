# General Government Debt

## OECD Visualization

*The following three visualizations represent different methods to display the same government debt information between the years of 1995 and 2019.*

The graph below was gathered from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) website. It captures data on the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP, which is a primary index for the sustainability of government finance.

## Flourish Visualization #1

The graph below is a grid of line charts created with the on-line tool titled, Flourish. It shows the same general government debt from OECD, but with the values from each country having their own individual mini chart.

## Flourish Visualization #2

The graph is a variation of the chart Flourish chart shown above. This time, I created a single, stacked area chart to deemphasize the individual countries and highlight the pattern of debt-to-GDP ratios over the course of the 1995-2019 time frame.

After analyzing the three different methods of visualizations, it appears that the OECD graph is the most coomprehensive in terms of displaying all the general debt information. Though the lines may be clustered, the visualization offers an interactive experience whill allows viewers to scroll over each data point to see the corresponding country. The first Flourish graphic also captures each country's analytics, but this time with individual charts. I think this is valuable for a particular audience who's looking to analyze general debt government per country. Lastly, the third Flouish visualization is a single, stacked area chart. As mentioned before, I chose this method to deemphasize the individual countries and highlight the pattern of debt-to-GDP ratios over the course of the 1995-2019 time frame. Though it doesnt allow interaction for the individual countries, it offers a visual perspective of the peaks and plumments of government debt throughout the alotted time frame, such as the 2007 trough where the debt-to-GDP ratio was at its lowest. It also generates a picture for the audience to better process the information. Finally, I chose a red-dominant color scheme for both Flourish visualizations because I thought it was an appropriate color considering the topic of debt, in comparison to the color green, for example, which often symbolized money and growth.
