# General Government Debt

The following three visualizations represent different methods to display the same government debt information between the years of 1995 and 2019.

The graph below was gathered from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) website. It captures data on the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP, which is a primary index for the sustainability of government finance.

## Flourish Visualization #1

The graph below is a grid of line charts created with the on-line tool titled, Flourish. It shows the same general government debt from OECD, but with the values from each country having their own individual mini chart.

## Flourish Visualization #2

The graph is a variation of the chart Flourish chart shown above. This time, I created a single, stacked area chart to deemphasize the individual countries and highlight the pattern of debt-to-GDP ratios over the course of the 1995-2019 time frame.
